When you get your first job as a Software Engineer, it‚Äôs pretty amazing. Most
people out of college or coding bootcamps get their first entry level jobs. From
what I am aware of the people around me who have entered in the tech field, can
last up to 3 years in their first job. Developers who look for a new workplace
look for a pay that is higher, the culture is popping, and the diversity is
real, and the benefits are above average. There is a bunch of reasons but
sometimes you‚Äôre just ready for the next challenge in your life. I‚Äôm the type
that needs to change ever so often or I simply start to break down like a
machine. I need to hit the reset button and change my environment.

When you have finally locked in a job offer or if you are lucky, multiple, you
have just created leverage and the opportunity to negotiate you salary and/or
benefits. You should always negotiate anyways unless whatever you are being
offered is exactly what you want. No pressure. That‚Äôs the great part of finding
a new job. The stuff that sucks is telling your current job if you have one.
It‚Äôs very hard especially if you‚Äôve emotionally invested your time in that
company and loved the people you worked with. As a software engineer who left
her first job, I have a couple lessons learned that may help you. I‚Äôm here to
help you make that transition when you‚Äôre still a junior developer going into
your second job in your career. This can actually apply to any level.

### **Keeping your current job in the loop**

I believe this is the most important. Everyone knows you should give a
sufficient amount of time of notice for your employer to find your replacement.
In tech sometimes you could be working on projects that you had been expected to
be on for weeks or months from now. You could have had a valuable skill set that
needs to be replaced immediately after your departure. Keeping your current
employer in the loop could be very helpful not only for them but for yourself as
well to make sure your last paycheck will be enough until the next job starts.
It also can be scary to let your employer know you have been interviewing in
other places. For one thing, what if you tell them but then you don‚Äôt even get a
job. That gets pretty awkward really quickly. If you feel comfortable with that
situation, let them know. If not, try to keep them informed once you‚Äôve received
an offer.

One other important key item is if your current employer offers vacation days
and you have days that you have not taken yet, it would be a great idea to
figure out what happens to your accrued vacation time when the relationship
between your and company is terminated. Some states require companies to pay out
their employees if they offer the benefit, some courts leave it up to the
company. It could be an important discussion when getting hired. This obviously
doesn‚Äôt apply in places where your vacation is untracked or it is still a
non-existent benefit.

### Keeping your possible employers in the loop

You want to let the companies you could potentially be working for that you are
interviewing with other companies. It helps with moving their interview process
to match where you are with the other companies. It also helps with trying to
get your offers quickly and at the same time so you can make a proper decision.
Some companies like to give a capped time until when you can finally accept or
decline the offer. Don‚Äôt be scared to ask for extension if you need one.

### Balance your current job and multiple interviews

It can get pretty crazy interviewing with companies and also staying up to date
on your current projects at work. Some people can either take their personal day
or if you have the luxury to work from home that gives you little bit more
leeway to makeup any hours lost in the day. Most interviews that are in office
can take anywhere from 2‚Äì3 hours.

I realized after talking to many recruiters, they led me to dead end streets. I
decided to use my community of Women Who Code Atlanta to assist me in finding
the right company. I had decided instead of trying to apply to 30 companies, I
was going to focus on one job I really wanted. I worked hard to meet all the
potential people I could be working with by introducing myself to everyone at
conferences if their company was in attendance, attending any events they held,
and constantly showing my interest. When you have that one person who is willing
to help you get your foot in the door the rest is up to you. While focusing on
this one company, I was able to get an opportunity to interview with another
well known company. It lead me down a road I thought I would never be on. It
turned into focusing on two great companies in Atlanta. This was definitely and
quality over quantity situation.

### If you have multiple offers: How to pick the right job

<span class="figcaption_hack">[https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/)</span>

One thing for sure is if you have companies convincing you they are the best
choice, do not take their word for it. Ask people you might know who work there.
Ask them to be honest. Ask someone you know you would relate to you on a
personal level. For example I am a person of color. I wanted to know what‚Äôs the
diversity like at that company. When you ask someone for their opinion, remember
it is *their perspective*. Not every workplace is perfect but it‚Äôs up to you to
find out what you are getting yourself into.

If you are comparing benefits,

1.  Examine the insurance companies. Do they cover your domestic partner?
1.  Check how they match on the 401(K).
1.  Do you have stock options?
1.  Are they flexible with your work schedule?
1.  What‚Äôs your preference on vacations days, limited or untracked?
1.  Are you allowed to work from home?
1.  When will you have performance reviews or when will your next raise occur?

These are just a few items you should consider. You just have to ask yourself
what matters the most to you.

Lastly, to me mentorship is big deal breaker to me. I wanted to be in a role
where I would have a good amount of resources I can get support from. I also
wanted to turn the tables around and find my way to give back to others. I am
very huge in being in a company that values having debates and discussions about
the best way to approach things.

Ultimately, a lot of people‚Äôs highest deal breaker could be money. You don‚Äôt get
into a new job to be paid less unless you are pivoting to something new in your
life or you just feel the company is totally worth it. Going back to verifying
when those raises will occur can come into play when trying to decide if the
salary they are offering you is perfect for you in the present moment or not
ideal in the long run.

I hope this helps someone who will be embarking on their journey of finally
accepting the right offer, saying goodbye to their current employer, and saying
hello to their future at the new company.

### **Interested in the technical parts?**

I will be speaking [REFACTR.TECH](http://refactr.tech/) in Atlanta, GA about my
experience with the technical portions of my interviews. I will go over some
common questions companies ask for conceptually and also the most important
things to know in when you are coding. I hope to discuss what kind of questions
they ask and what they are looking for in Junior and Mid-Level Developers.

### What is REFACTR.TECH ?

REFACTR.TECH is all about growing and showcasing powerful voices of marginalized
people and allies in tech. For three days, REFACTR.TECH focuses on technology
while creating a safe space or thoughtful and nuanced conversations around
diversity, inclusion, and intersectionality in tech.

If you are interested in speaking. CFP closes Feb 15! More details
