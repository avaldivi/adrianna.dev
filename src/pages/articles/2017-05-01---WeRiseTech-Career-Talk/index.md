If you haven’t heard yet, We Rise Women in Tech Conference hosted by [Women Who
Code Atlanta](http://meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Atlanta) is June 23rd & 24th 2017 at
The Loudermilk Conference Center.

I will be giving a talk with my best friend [Kamilah
Kiser](https://medium.com/@KamilahKiser). We both graduated from the same
[school](http://ggc.edu/), handle social media channels for WWC ATL. We initally
applied to talk at We Rise because we wanted to discuss our road to
kick-starting our careers. Since then, Kamilah has successfully landed a
position as a UX Design Intern at SITA this past week 👏🏼 I am a Junior
Front-End Developer still looking for opportunities.

Our talk will be based on a couple of things. Our title is, *Life after
Graduation: The
Struggle*.
As you can imagine we’re going to speak of our experiences; the good, the bad,
and the ugly parts of finding a job before and after graduation. This talk is
not only for college graduates, but all graduates, code newbies, people who were
self-taught and now looking for their start in the tech world.

If you didn’t notice already, [Kamilah Kiser](https://medium.com/@KamilahKiser)
and I are women of color. We know one or two things about conscious bias but we
also know a thing or two about fighting it and how to keep moving forward.

“*Finding a job out of college is easy*” said no one ever. Finding a job from
any point in a career probably gets a little tedious at some point from
interviewing, salary negotiation, and finding the best culture that matches you.
We’re also not a pair of entitled millennials who think we deserve jobs. We just
know we work hard and we will continue to do so and **never settle for less**.

I believe finding a job should not be done alone and what I mean is having a
support group is important. Let’s be honest, in some cases we can begin to doubt
ourselves if we haven’t reached that level of confidence, the all too familiar
enemy in our head: Imposter Syndrome. If you forget to remind yourself; of who
you are, why you began this path, and where you want end up, your support group
is there to remind you. Ultimately, you decide your own fate.

We have lots of stories to tell and advice we’d like to give based on our
experience. We want hear from you too. If you’re attending the conference, we
hope to see you there. If you’re not, we hope you can reconsider because the
line-up of speakers are phenomenal from across the world to our own homegrown
ATLiens 😉

**UPDATE:**<br> As of May 22nd 2017, I have acquired a position at Polar Notion as a
React Native Apprenctice.
